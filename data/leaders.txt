Strategy: Form early alliances and coordinate attacks. War Cart rush remains devastating.
Use alliance combat bonuses for quick domination.
Pro-strat: IGNORE SCIENCE. Spam War Carts from turn 1. They have no counter in the Ancient Era. Declare war on your nearest neighbor immediately. Pillage mines/farms to fund more carts. Do not build a Campus until you have conquered at least 2 neighbors.

- Earn Culture equal to 50% of defeated unit's combat strength.
Strategy: Aggressive early wars for culture. Combine Hoplite combat bonuses with culture rewards. Military victories accelerate civic tree.

Strategy: Chain Wonder building with expansion. Time Wonder completions for maximum Builder/Settler efficiency.
Pro-strat: "Zombie Army." Use the "Convert Barbarians" melee action on your units. Find a Barbarian clan, let them spawn high-tech units, converts them, and turn them against your enemies. It effectively lets you buy an army for the cost of a few melee units.

- Gain 1 Envoy whenever you recruit a Great Person.
Strategy: Great Person generation = city-state control.
Pro-strat: "Rough Rider Trade." Rough Rider units gain Culture from kills on their home continent. But the real strat is trade. Send trade routes to City-States you Suzerain. The yields are massive. Use the "Diplomatic League" card to double envoys and control the World Congress.

=== TEDDY_ROOSEVELT_BULL_MOOSE ===
Leader Ability: Antiquities and Parks
- +2 Science to all tiles with Breathtaking Appeal.
- +2 Culture to all tiles in a city with a National Park.
- +1 Appeal to all tiles in a city with a Preserve or National Park.
Strategy: Preserve district focus.
Pro-strat: "Appeal Yields." Restart until you spawn near Mountains/Woods. Do not chop. Build "Preserve" districts. Rush "Eiffel Tower". Breathtaking tiles give Science/Culture immediately (Tech/Civic tree agnostic). You can have a Science victory without building a single Campus.

=== NZINGA_MBANDE ===
Leader Ability: Njinga Mbandi
- +50% Production toward units when at war with a major civ.
- Defeated enemy units grant Gold.
Strategy: War economy. More war = more production = more gold.
Pro-strat: "Forever War." Declare war on a distant Civ that cannot reach you. Stay at war for the entire game. Enjoy the permanent +10% Yields to your home continent cities (Leader Ability - check actual ability, often +10% yields on home continent). *Correction*: Leader ability is +10% Yields on home continent. Stay on your continent and boom.

=== RAMSES_II ===
Leader Ability: Abu Simbel
- Completing a Wonder grants a free random relic.
- +2 Gold and +2 Culture from resources.
Strategy: Wonder rush + relic collection. Relics provide early tourism.
Pro-strat: "Monumentality Expansion." Build Pyramids and Oracle. The Culture from resources gets you to "Feudalism" fast. The Culture allows you to reach "Political Philosophy" fast. The real power is stacking Wonder-granted production. Focus on "Temple of Artemis" and "Hanging Gardens" to grow cities that can work more tiles.

=== WU_ZETIAN ===
Leader Ability: Sage Empress
- +50% Production toward Builders.
- Buildings and Districts can be rushed by Builders (15% of total cost per charge).
Strategy: Builder rush completion.
Pro-strat: "Spy Rush." Wu gets a spy early (Defensive Tactics). Use the spy to siphon funds or steal tech immediately. But mainly: Build Ancestral Hall. Spam Settlers. New cities get free Builders. Use those Builders to *rush the districts* in the new city. Instant infrastructure.

=== YONGLE ===
Leader Ability: Mandate of Heaven
- Projects in cities with a Governor provide +20% of their yields.
- Governors gain +1 Movement Range.
Strategy: Governor placement matters more. Projects have better payoff. Governor synergy focus.
Pro-strat: "The Pop 10 Rush." Ignore districts in new cities. Immediately run the "Lijia (Food)" project. Grow the city to 10 Population ASAP. At 10 Pop, you get +20 Gold/Science/Culture per turn (Leader Ability). Use the Gold to *buy* the districts later. Faith-buy Settlers to repeat the loop.

=== LUDWIG_II ===
Leader Ability: Swan King
- +2 Culture from Wonders in cities with a Castle.
- Wonders built by Germany provide +1 Great Person point of the appropriate type.
Strategy: Wonder collection.
Pro-strat: "Unfinished Wonder Tourism." Place a Wonder foundation. Do not finish it immediately. It generates Tourism from adjacency instantly. Ludwig gains Culture from adjacencies. Plan massive Hansa/Commercial Hub clusters, but reserve spots for Wonders just for the culture yield, even if you finish them late.

=== FREDERICK_III ===
Leader Ability: Patron of the Free Cities
- +2 Production to all specialty districts from Suzerainty bonuses.
- +1 Favor for each Suzerain bonus.
Strategy: City-state dominance. Production stacking from Suzerainty. Diplomatic favor generation.
Pro-strat: "District Spam." This leader is about quantity. Suzerain everything. Every district gets +Production. Build the cheapest district in every city (often Commercial Hub or Harbor). The production bonus stacks up to give you insane industrial output. Win via Science or War using your massive production base.

=== ELEANOR_FRANCE ===
Leader Ability: Court of Love
- Great Works in Eleanor's cities cause -1 Loyalty per turn in foreign cities within 9 tiles.
- A city that leaves another civilization due to Loyalty pressure and joins Eleanor skips the "Free City" phase and joins immediately.
Strategy: Peaceful Domination. Forward settle opponents. Move Great Works to border cities to exert pressure.
Pro-strat: "The Art Conveyor Belt." This is the only Civ that can conquer the world without declaring war. Move ALL Great Works to your border cities. Do not leave them in the Capital. As soon as an enemy city flips to you (instant flip), move the Great Works *into* that new city on the same turn. This resets the 9-tile range further into their territory. You create a rolling "death wave" of loyalty that consumes empires one city at a time.

=== ELEANOR_ENGLAND ===
Leader Ability: Court of Love (Same as France)
- Inherits England's "Workshop of the World" (Production/Coal bonuses) and "Royal Navy Dockyard".
Strategy: Use English production to build Theater Squares and Industrial Zones. High population cities exert more loyalty.
Pro-strat: "Weaponized Capitalism." Unlike France, England has Gold and Production. Build Royal Navy Dockyards to generate massive Gold. Use that Gold to BUY Great Works from the AI (don't wait to earn them). Use England's massive Industrial Zone production to run the "Bread and Circuses" project non-stop in border cities. The combination of purchased Art + Bread and Circuses pressure allows you to flip cities even faster than the French version.
